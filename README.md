## Introduction

I'm Alan Aguilar, a 21 year old Frontend Developer, Musician and Minimalist Graphic Designer based in Santa Fe, Argentina.

I started venturing into the world of programming when I was 18 years old. I was always interested in absolutely all kinds of technology, and programming was something I didn't dare to fully explore... Until I gave it a chance, and to this day it has been one of my best decisions throughout of my life.

I became so passionate about the profession that little by little I began to form several personal projects. And who would say... What was once just another hobby/entertainment, soon became my profession and my job today.
