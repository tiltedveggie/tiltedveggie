## Introduction

I'm Alan Aguilar, a Frontend Developer, Musician and Minimalist Graphic Designer based in Santa Fe, Argentina.

I started venturing into the world of programming when I was 18 years old. I was always interested in absolutely all kinds of technology, and programming was something I didn't dare to fully explore... Until I gave it a chance, and to this day it has been one of my best decisions throughout of my life.

I became so passionate about the profession that little by little I began to create several personal projects. And who would say... What used to be a hobby/entertainment soon became my profession and my current job.

## "What technologies and softwares are you currently working with?"

Currently I make use of multiple tools, such as:

<table>
  <thead>
      <th> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br> Technology <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</th>
      <th>Framework/Library</th>
    </tr>
